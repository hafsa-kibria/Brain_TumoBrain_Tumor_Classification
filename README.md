# Brain_TumoBrain_Tumor_Classification
This repository contains the code for classifying four types of brain tumors (glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary) using a novel approach that combines a lightweight Parallel Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Network (PDSCNN) and a Hybrid Ridge Regression Extreme Learning Machine (RRELM).
