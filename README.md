# Brain Tumor Classification

This repository contains the dataset and code for the research titled:
**"Brain Tumor Classification Using Parallel Depthwise Separable CNN and Hybrid Ridge Regression Extreme Learning Machine"**.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes MRI images of brain tumors, with four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. These images were used to train a model for tumor classification based on deep learning techniques.

### Features:
- **MRI Images:** Preprocessed MRI scans of the brain.
- **Tumor Classes:** Four classes are identified in the dataset:
  - **Glioma**
  - **Meningioma**
  - **Pituitary Tumor**
  - **No Tumor**

### Data Collection:
The dataset contains MRI images from publicly available sources, each labeled according to the type of brain tumor. These images are resized and preprocessed to enhance the feature extraction process.

## Usage
Researchers can use this dataset for:
- Developing deep learning models for brain tumor classification.
- Investigating the use of depthwise separable convolutions for feature extraction.
- Exploring hybrid machine learning models like Ridge Regression Extreme Learning Machine (RRELM) for classification tasks.

### Suggested Tools:
- Python: For data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, XGBoost.
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn.
